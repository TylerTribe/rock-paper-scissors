The rock, paper, scissors game from the Odin Project (https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-rock-paper-scissors)

I learned a ton about calling and defining functions and getting everything in my html and css to go where I want it to.

The project took me about 12 hours, most of the time was spent learning how to implement javascript functions on clicking an image,
and some time was spent figuring out why my CSS wasn't working as intended.
